MetPy is a Python library for meteorology that provides tools for reading, visualizing, and performing calculations with weather data. 

Assuming you have weather data in a suitable format (such as NetCDF or Grib), let's go through an example that involves reading data from a NetCDF file, visualizing a Skew-T diagram, and performing calculations such as calculating potential temperature and wind speed.

1. Install MetPy if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install metpy
```

2. Import the necessary libraries and set up the code:

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from metpy.plots import SkewT
from metpy.calc import potential_temperature, wind_speed, dry_lapse

# Load a sample NetCDF file (replace with your data file)
data_path = 'path_to_your_data.nc'
ds = xr.open_dataset(data_path)
```

3. Plot a Skew-T diagram using MetPy:

```python
# Extract temperature, dewpoint, and pressure data
temperature = ds['temperature']
dewpoint = ds['dewpoint']
pressure = ds['pressure']

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9, 9))
skew = SkewT(fig, rotation=45)

# Plot temperature, dewpoint, and wind profile
skew.plot(pressure, temperature, 'r', label='Temperature')
skew.plot(pressure, dewpoint, 'g', label='Dewpoint')

# Add wind barbs
u_wind = ds['u_wind']
v_wind = ds['v_wind']
skew.plot_barbs(pressure, u_wind, v_wind)

# Customize the Skew-T plot
skew.ax.set_ylim(1000, 100)
skew.ax.set_xlim(-40, 60)
skew.ax.set_title('Skew-T Diagram')
skew.ax.set_xlabel('Temperature (Â°C)')
skew.ax.set_ylabel('Pressure (hPa)')
skew.ax.legend()
skew.plot_dry_adiabats()
skew.plot_moist_adiabats()
skew.plot_mixing_lines()

plt.show()
```

4. Calculate potential temperature and wind speed using MetPy:

```python
# Calculate potential temperature
potential_temp = potential_temperature(pressure, temperature)

# Calculate wind speed
wspd = wind_speed(u_wind, v_wind)

# Add the calculated fields to the dataset
ds['potential_temperature'] = potential_temp
ds['wind_speed'] = wspd

# Save the modified dataset
output_path = 'output_data_with_calculations.nc'
ds.to_netcdf(output_path)
```

Remember to replace `'path_to_your_data.nc'` with the actual path to your data file and adjust variable names and dimensions based on your data structure. MetPy's documentation provides more details about its functions and capabilities: https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/index.html
